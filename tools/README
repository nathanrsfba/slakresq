Scripts in this folder:

mkbase
    Create the base filesystem for the core bundle. By default, this includes
    disksets a, ap and l, which is the minimum required for the Linux Live Kit
    script to run. To use a different set, pass the disksets you want on the
    command line, or change the option in the config file.

    It may be possible to build with just diskset a, if you move the necessary
    packages out of ap and l into a (mksquashfs, mkisofs, and their
    dependencies). This is untested, and I still need to work out exactly what
    packages are needed.

buildlive
    Creates the SlakResQ tree in target/. This will not re-create target,
    but will instead will update any changed files, and leave anything
    else intact.

extdiskset
    Extracts a set of disksets, and saves the resulting filesystem tree into
    trees/. This uses overlayfs to mount a filesystem overtop base/, this
    saving only the files changed by installing the given disksets.

    The first parameter should be the name of the resulting bundle (minus file
    extension), the rest should be a list of disksets to install. Ex:

        tools/extdiskset 20-dev d e tcl

fetchinstall
    Downloads all installer disksets into install/ from the mirror specified
    in the config. Note that this does not attempt to download any diskset that
    already appears to exist, so as to not remove any potentially updated
    packages

fetchinstall
    Downloads updates from the configured mirror site. Unlike fetchinstall,
    this *does* attempt to update an existing updates directory

finddupes
    This displays a list of all files that appear in multiple bundle trees.
    You may wish to run this before squashing the bundles, and examining the
    resulting list to see if any conflicts need to be addressed.

updatepkgs
    This will update the packages in the install/ directory with packages
    found in the updates/ directory. You can find updates in the
    slackware64/patches/packages directory in the Slackware mirrors.

    The following command line arguments are supported:

    -v: Verbose. Displays what packages are being updated, the old and new
    versions, and what packages are already up to date, or weren't found in
    the install tree (normal if you don't have all the disksets). By default,
    only outputs the names of packages that are updated.
    -q: Quiet. Don't display anything at all
    -t: Test. Don't make any changes, just display what would be updated. Note
    that specifying this with -q would just be silly.

squashbundle
    Squshes a bundle (or set of bundles) in trees into a bundle file.
    Parameters are the name(s) of the bundle(s) to squash (minus file
    extension). Ex:

        tools/squashbundle 10-net 20-dev 90-x11

    By default, creates bundles out of all folders in trees/
